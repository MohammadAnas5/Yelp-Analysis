## Profiling and Analysis 
This project involves working with a dataset from Yelp, a US-based organization that provides a platform for users to provide reviews and rate their interactions with various organizations. As a data scientist, our task is to analyze this dataset using SQL to answer a series of questions and make inferences based on our findings.

In the first part of the project, we are given a set of questions to answer about the data. These questions will help us profile and understand the data better, and we will be assessed on both the correctness of our findings and the code we use to arrive at our answers.

In the second part of the project, we are asked to come up with our own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular question we want to answer using SQL. This part of the project will require us to think critically about the data and use our analytical skills to draw meaningful insights from it.

Overall, this project will provide us with valuable experience working with real-world data and applying SQL to extract insights and answer questions. It will also help us develop our problem-solving and analytical skills, which are essential for any data scientist.
